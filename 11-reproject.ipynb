    "# Reprojecting/resampling data\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, the Astropy project consists not just of the core astropy package but also of coordinated package (which are managed by the project) and affiliated packages (which adhere to the coding, testing, and documentation standards of the project but are not managed by the project). All the functionality we've seen in previous tutorials was in the core package, but we now look at one of the coordinated packages: [reproject](https://reproject.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). The aim of this package is to make it possible to reproject/resample data from one WCS to another. This is useful when trying to compare images pixel to pixel, make color composite images, or mosaics."
