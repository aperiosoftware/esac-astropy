    "While we won't go into detail about this, we wanted to mention the packages in the Astropy ecosystem that can be used for CCD and spectroscopic data reduction and analysis.\n",

    "[Ccdproc](https://ccdproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an Astropy coordinated package for basic data reduction of CCD data which relies on the CCDData class in the astropy.nddata module. A [CCD reduction guide](https://mwcraig.github.io/ccd-as-book/00-00-Preface.html) has been written Matt Craig (one of the ccdproc lead developers) using ccdproc as one of the main packages (this is intended to provide a modern counterpart of the original IRAF CCD Reduction guide).\n",

    "\n",
    "The [specutils](https://specutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package is an Astropy coordinated package for the representation and analysis of spectra. It is currently undergoing some significant changes/improvements, so we do not look at it in detail here."
